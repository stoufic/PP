            <!--Discrpition of Girrafes-->
            Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, known for their long necks and legs, and distinctive spotted patterns. These gentle giants roam the open grasslands in small groups and are native to Africa. Their height allows them to eat leaves from tall trees, typically acacia species, that other herbivores can't reach.
