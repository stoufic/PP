            <h2>About Me..</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Toufic Saleh, currently in my final year as a computer 
                science student at Virginia Tech. My technical repertoire 
                encompasses a wide array of skills essential for modern tech 
                endeavors. Proficient in programming languages like Python, 
                Java, and C++, I also have a solid grasp of web development 
                frameworks such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Moreover, my 
                expertise extends to networking, data structures and algorithms, 
                and operating systems. Whether it's configuring intricate network 
                architectures, optimizing data structures for efficiency, or 
                delving into the intricacies of operating system functionality, 
                I thrive on the challenges presented by these core components 
                of computing.
            <br><br>
            Beyond mastering technical intricacies, my overarching aim is to 
            leverage technology for impactful change. I envision a world where 
            technology serves as a force for good, addressing pressing societal 
            challenges and enhancing lives. From developing software solutions 
            that streamline processes to contributing to projects that advance 
            accessibility and sustainability, I'm committed to making a tangible 
            difference in the tech industry. Let's collaborate and innovate, as 
            we harness the transformative potential of technology to create a 
            brighter, more inclusive future for all.

            <h3> Stock Predictor</h3>
            <p>
                In this project, I developed an advanced stock price predictor using 
                Python, leveraging the yfinance library for historical stock data 
                acquisition and scikit-learn for its extensive machine learning 
                functionalities. The application allows for user-defined stock symbol 
                input, employing sophisticated data preprocessing and feature engineering 
                to optimize the input for the RandomForestRegressor model. With a focus 
                on enhancing the machine learning foundation, I iterated on model selection, 
                parameter tuning, and performance evaluation to ensure accurate and robust 
                stock price predictions.

            <h3>Automated News Email</h3>
            <p>
                    I've made a Python email bot that smartly aggregates and condenses daily 
                news from Google News, Bing News, and Twitter for users, based on their 
                specific interests indicated by the notifications they've activated for 
                certain followers. By ensuring that the bot curates content only from followed 
                entities with active notifications, it delivers a highly personalized and relevant 
                news digest directly to users' inboxes every evening at 10 pm, making staying 
                informed both effortless and efficient. This project not only highlights my adeptness 
                in API integration and Python programming but also underscores my commitment to 
                creating user-centric solutions.

            <h3>Youtube NoteTaker Chrome Extension</h3>
            <p>
                    I developed "YouTube NoteTaker," a Chrome extension designed to enhance the learning 
                experience on YouTube. This tool allows users to mark specific timestamps during a video 
                to create checkpoints, where they can add detailed notes for later reference. It's 
                particularly aimed at aiding students in their study sessions by enabling digital annotations 
                directly within the YouTube interface. These checkpoints and notes are persistently saved 
                within the extension, allowing users to return to them or navigate between different videos 
                without losing their data. Completing this project honed my skills in JavaScript, Chrome API 
                utilization, and UI/UX design, further solidifying my ability to create practical, user-focused 
                applications.
